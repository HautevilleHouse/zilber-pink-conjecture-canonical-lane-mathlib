This package pins `canonical-lane-mathlib` at commit `18ec6fb1d6c29a2404ae5125c2e0d15585b57398` (reachable even if that repository's `main` has moved).

## Claim boundary

This repository is a source-derived formalization / proof-boundary layer. It does not enlarge the classical claim beyond the paired lane package and that package's carried remainder. Treat unchecked classical remainder as open.
